# -IDMB-DATASET-ANALYSIS
Hello everyone, I am Somnath Das. I'm thrilled to share that I've just completed my first project in Python using pandas, numpy and seaborn. I designed an engaging dashboard using Python that allows for the monitoring and analysis of the IDMB DATASET ANALYSIS. So, let's dive deep into the project and provide some analysis.
QUESTIONS:-
1. DISPLAY TOP 10 ROWS OF THE DATASET.
2. CHECK LAST 10 ROWS OF THE DATASET.
3. FIND SHAPE OF OUR DATASET(NUMBER OF ROWS AND NUMBER OF COLUMNS).
4. GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT OUR DATASET LIKE TOTAL NUMBER OF ROWS, COLUMNS, DATATYPES OF EACH COLUMN AND MEMORY REQUIREMENT.
5. CHECK MISSING VALUES IN THE DATASET.
6. DROP ALL THE MISSING VALUES.
7. GET OVERALL STATISTICS ABOUT THE DATAFRAME.
8.CHECK FOR DUPLICATE DATA.
9. DISPLAY TITLE OF THE MOVIE HAVING RUNTIME GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 180 MINS.
10. IN WHICH YEAR THERE WAS THE HIGHEST AVERAGE VOTING?
11. IN WHICH YEAR THERE WAS THE HIGHEST AVERAGE REVENUE?
12. FIND THE AVERAGE RATING FOR EACH DINNER.
13. DISPLAY NUMBER OF MOVIES PER YEAR.
14. DISPLAY NUMBER OF MOVIES TITLE(HIGHEST REVENUE).
15. DISPLAY TOP 10 HIGHEST RATED MOVIE TITLES AND ITS DIRECTIONS.
16. DISPLAY TOP 10 HIGHEST REVENUE MOVIE TITLES.
17. FIND AVERAGE RATING OF MOVIES YEAR WISE.
18. DOES RATING AFFECT THE REVENUE?
19. CLASSIFY MOVIES BASED ON RATINGS[EXCELLENT, GOOD AND AVERAGE.]
20. COUNT NUMBER OF ACTION MOVIES.
21. FIND UNIQUE VALUES FROM GENRE.Hello everyone, I am Somnath Das. I'm thrilled to share that I've just completed my first project in Python using pandas, numpy and seaborn.
